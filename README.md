Project Description :

	This project aims to create a game using Pacman-Ping Pong logic, which will be coded in
	C++.The player can move both up/down and left/right using the keyboard and avoid the
	moving obstacles which will be moving with the help of ping-pong ball logic. The player can
	create wall to trap the moving obstacle and eat all the points  and then score will be
	added to the playerâ€™s scoreboard. Each time the player eats a straberry it gets a power ups for 5 seconds , means player can create new wall by pressing key "W" and new wall will be added to the map . Once all the point will be eaten then player can go to the next level.
